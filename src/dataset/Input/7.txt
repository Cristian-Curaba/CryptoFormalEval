# Protocol 7

### Knowledge

A : A, B, pubB
B : A, B, skB, pubB

where pubB is a public asymmetric key, skB is the secret asymmetric key.
### Actions

A → B : aenc((A,Na), pubB)
B → A : senc(Nb, h(Na))
A → B : aenc(h(Nb), pubB)

where h(Na) is used as symmetric key, Na is freshly generated by A, Nb is freshly generated by B.

### Property

Non-repudiation of Na from A


lemma nonrepudiation:
"All x client #t1 . (ReceivedFrom(client, x)@t1 ==> Ex #t2 . SentBy(client, x)@t2 ∧ t2 < t1 )"
