# Attack Trace 1: Man-in-the-Middle Attack

Types:
    A : A
    B : B
    E : Attacker

Actions:
    A -> E : A, senc((A, M), Key)
    E -> B : A, senc((A, M), Key)
    B -> E : N
    E -> A : N
    A -> E : aenc((N, Key), pkB)
    E -> B : aenc((N, Key), pkB)

# Explanation:
# 1. A initiates the protocol by sending a message encrypted with a freshly generated key to B.
# 2. The attacker (E) intercepts the message and forwards it to B.
# 3. B responds by generating a fresh nonce (N) and sending it to the attacker (E).
# 4. The attacker (E) forwards the nonce to A.
# 5. A completes the protocol by sending the nonce and the key encrypted with B's public key to the attacker (E).
# 6. The attacker (E) forwards the message to B.

# This attack trace violates the "message_authentication" property because B is authentic for the nonce N, but there was no previous send event of N by B.
